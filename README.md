This project is to develop a framework to compute crop vulnerability and food production level based on micro-climate indices namely land surface temperature, Normalized difference Vegetation index, Gross Primary Production, soil moisture and rainfall data. These data were obtained from Google Earth Engine data catolog using the code editor functions. The study was done for Ballarat to identify the crop vulnerability for Autumn season. This framework completely based on pyqgis script. Therefore, the script can be followed any researcher to run uploading their own data which above mention datasets, but to any place. In the script, formula was created to form the indexes and normalise the data, then developed the loops to find the food production level and crop vulnerability level, finally the levels were illustrate using the symbology.
